We are a research lab at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)** advancing the understanding and capabilities of generative intelligence systems, bridging the gap between large-scale models and real-world applications.

## Principal Investigator

**Dr. Tao Hu (胡涛)** leads the lab with a focus on pushing the boundaries of generative AI. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam in 2023, where he was supervised by Prof. Cees Snoek and Prof. Pascal Mettes, followed by postdoctoral research at the renowned CompVis Group (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) under Prof. Björn Ommer—the team behind Stable Diffusion. His research spans diffusion models, flow matching, and efficient generative architectures, with publications at top-tier venues including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, and T-PAMI. Notable contributions include Self-Guided Diffusion Models (CVPR 2023), which pioneered self-supervised guidance for diffusion; ZigMa (ECCV 2024), the first DiT-style Mamba-based diffusion model; DepthFM (AAAI 2025 Oral), achieving fast monocular depth estimation via flow matching; and ToddlerDiffusion (ICLR 2025), enabling interpretable controllable generation. He has received multiple oral and spotlight presentations, serves as Area Chair for CVPR workshops on AI for Content Creation and Efficient Large Vision Models, and was recognized as an Excellent Reviewer at NeurIPS 2024.
